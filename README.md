# DBedit
User friendly database editor not only for developers

## Requirements
- PHP 5.4 or higher
- MySql database
- Apache server with .htaccess enabled (to deny access to config folder)

## Concept and documentation
We strongly recommend reading about [DBedit design](https://github.com/scanzy/DBedit/wiki#dbedit-design) (concept) in the wiki.

Documentation (about [configuration](https://github.com/scanzy/DBedit/wiki#dbedit-configuration) and [logs](https://github.com/scanzy/DBedit/wiki#dbedit-logs)) is also in the wiki.

Note: the project is stable, but **not all requirements in documentation have been implemented**.
